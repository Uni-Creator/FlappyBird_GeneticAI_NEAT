# Flappy Bird AI using NEAT

This repository contains a **Flappy Bird AI** powered by the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. The AI learns to play the game by evolving neural networks through generations, with each generation getting better at passing pipes and surviving longer.

## Overview

This project uses **NEAT** to evolve a population of neural networks that control birds in a simple **Flappy Bird** game. The network decides whether the bird should jump based on inputs such as the bird's position relative to the pipes.

## Features

- **NEAT algorithm**: Used to evolve neural networks over generations.
- **Pygame**: For game rendering and mechanics.
- **Live Plotting**: Tracks the best and mean scores across generations.
- **Flexible configurations**: Customize the network and game parameters for various experiments.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **NEAT-Python**: Library for the NEAT algorithm.
- **Pygame**: For rendering and game mechanics.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the training progress.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlappyBird-AI.git
cd FlappyBird-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python packages:

- `pygame==2.5.2`
- `neat-python==0.92`
- `matplotlib==3.8.4`

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works

- **NEAT Setup**: The neural network evolves with each generation, using the NEAT algorithm to modify its structure.

- **Fitness Function**: The bird's survival time and its score (how many pipes it passes) determine its fitness.

- **Game Mechanics**: Pygame is used to simulate the Flappy Bird game, including the movement of pipes, the bird's jumping action, and the game's scoring system.

## Training the AI

To start training the AI, run the following command:

```bash
python flappy_trainer.py
```

The training process will evolve neural networks that control the bird. The training progress can be viewed in real-time using a plot that shows the best and mean scores per generation.

## Special Notes

After many trials and errors, I discovered that `bird.y` was not required for making the jump decision. Initially, I removed it from the inputs, but for some reason, the model performed worse. So, I added it back but switched to **FS-NEAT** connection types.

Here are some observations:

- **FS-NEAT Sparse Evolution**: This connection method evolved better models over time, but it didnâ€™t use the `y` position of the bird even though it was present in the input.

- **Partial Connections**: I tried different partial connection fractions like `0.0`, `0.1`, and `0.5`, but the results were similar to the baseline.

- **Crash Issue**: When I manually removed the `y` position from the input, the model crashed. Iâ€™m not sure why it crashes, so if anyone knows the cause, feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/singhrabhay) or [Gmail](mailto\:abhayr24564@gmail.com), or you can raise a pull request to fix it.

- **Full Connections**: Setting the connections to **full** causes the model to learn much faster, reaching the goal in just 3 or so generations. However, I prefer the model to be more efficient by reducing the number of inputs needed.

## Future Improvements

- **Efficiency**: I'm aiming to make the AI more efficient by reducing the number of required inputs while maintaining performance.

- **Better Neural Network Architectures**: Explore alternate NEAT configurations or neural network architectures for better results.
